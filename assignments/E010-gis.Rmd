## Reflection for element 011

### Background

Despite being globally of least concern in IUCN ratings due its wide range, the Willow Tit (*Poecile montanus*) is on the British Red List for species and is one of the most threatened resident British birds. [@theiucn2021] Its frequency has declined by over 90% since the 1970s and has lost the southern and south-eastern part of its range. @thedecl

According to the 4th British .. (BOCC) the Willow tit...@stanbury2017b; @eaton2015

Three hypotheses for the decline have been proposed:

-   Habitat loss

-   Competition for nesting sites from other *Paridae* especially the Great Tit (*Parus major*) and Blue tit ()

    -   It has been proposed that garden bird feeding has boosted the populations of other *Paridae* increasing potential competition (ref)

-   Predation by Greater spotted woodpeckers and Grey squirrels

In order to test

1.  Have there been further declines in Willow tit counts?
2.  What are the habitat preferences of the Willow tit
3.  Habitat overlaps (terminology?) between the Willow tit and competitors/ predators

### Data sources

1.  Species observation counts from the NBN atlas data set ()

2.  Habitat / land cover use from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (25m)

3.  Climate data from WorldClim

## Methods

1.  Trends in species observations

2.  Habitat preferences for Willow tit

3.  Trends in competitor / predator species in habitats occupied by Willow tits

4.  ? Species distribution model based on presence/absence

    1.  Climate variables

    2.  Predator y/n

    3.  Competitor y/n

    4.  Habitat

5.
