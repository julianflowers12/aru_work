            Abstract
            Evidence is accumulating of shifts in species’ distributions during recent climate
            warming. However, most of this information comes predominantly from studies of a
            relatively small selection of taxa (i.e., plants, birds and butterflies), which may not be
            representative of biodiversity as a whole. Using data from less well-studied groups, we
            show that a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species have moved northwards
            and uphill in Britain over approximately 25 years, mirroring, and in some cases
            exceeding, the responses of better-known groups.
